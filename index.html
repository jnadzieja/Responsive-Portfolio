                        I'm originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota and I have 5 siblings. Two of which are half-siblings,<br>
                        and two of which are 
                        step-siblings. Otherwise my closest sibling's name is Noah. 
                        He's 18 years<br>
                        old and just started school at UNCC this year. I moved to North Carolina when I was 11 years<br> 
                        old 
                        and I am currently 21 years old. I was born on July 11th, 1997. <br> 
                        <br>
                        Right now I am enrolled in the UNC: Charlotte full time coding bootcamp. And I am enjoying it<br> 
                        a lot. I'm really excited to see what the future holds onec I am done with the program. So far I<br>
                        think that the course has really teached me a lot but for the most part I am getting the hang of<br> 
                        it I'm also excited to really challenge myself later on in the course, and be able to do so much<br> 
                        more than I can currently.<br>
